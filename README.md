# Tasty Basic

## Introduction
Tasty Basic is a basic interpreter for the SBC v2, based on the Z80 port of Palo Alto Tiny Basic
([Gabbard, 2017; Rauskolb, 1976; Wang, 1976](##References)).

## Tasty Basic Language
The Tasty Basic language is based on Palo Alto Tiny Basic, as described in the December 1976
issue of Interface Age ([Rauskolb, 1976](##References)). As such, Tasty Basic shares many of the
same limitations as Palo Alto Basic. All numbers are integers and must be less than or
equal to 32767, and support for only 26 variables denoted by letters A through Z. In addition
to Tiny Basic's `ABS(n)`, `RND(n)` and `SIZE` functions, however, Tasty Basic provides statements and functions
to read and write memory locations, and allows interaction with I/O ports.

### Statements
Tasty Basic provides two statements to write to memory and I/O ports:

`POKE m,n` Writes the value _n_ to address location _m_

`OUT m,n` Sends the value n to I/O port _m_

Additionally there are statements to define and read constant values:

`DATA m[,n[,...]]` Used to store constant values in the program code. Each DATA statement can define one or more constants separated by commas. Note that `DATA` statements *must* appear before any `READ` statements.

`READ m` Reads the next available data value and assigns it to variable _m_, starting with the left most value in the first `DATA` statement.

### Functions
Tasty Basic provides the following functions to read from and write to memory locations and I/O ports:

`IN(m)` Returns the byte value read from I/O port _m_

`PEEK(m)` Returns the byte value of address location _m_

`USR(i)`  Accepts a numeric expression _i_ , calls a user-defined machine language routine, and returns the resulting value.

### User defined machine language routines
The `USR(i)` function enables interaction with user defined machine routines.
The entry point for these routines is specified using a vector at $09FE/$09FF,
which by default points to $0A00. The value _i_ is passed to the routine
in the `DE` register, which must also contain the result on return.

#### Example
The following example shows the bit summation for a given value:

```
0001   0A00             .ORG 2560
0002   0A00 06 00         LD B,0
0003   0A02 7A            LD A,D
0004   0A03 CD 0E 0A      CALL COUNT
0005   0A06 7B            LD A,E
0006   0A07 CD 0E 0A      CALL COUNT
0007   0A0A 58            LD E,B
0008   0A0B 16 00         LD D,0
0009   0A0D C9            RET
0010   0A0E             COUNT:
0011   0A0E FE 00         CP 0
0012   0A10 C8            RET Z
0013   0A11 CB 47         BIT 0,A
0014   0A13 28 01         JR Z,NEXT
0015   0A15 04            INC B
0016   0A16             NEXT:
0017   0A16 CB 3F         SRL A
0018   0A18 18 F4         JR COUNT
0019   0A1A             .END
```

```
10 DATA 6,0,122,205,14,10,123,205,14,10,88,22,0,201
20 DATA 254,0,200,203,71,40,1,4,203,63,24,244
30 FOR I=0 TO 25
40 READ A
50 POKE 2560+I,A
60 NEXT I
70 INPUT P
80 Q=USR(P)
90 PRINT "THE BIT SUMMATION OF "#5,P," IS "#2,Q
100 GOTO 70
```


## Building the ROM image

Building the ROM image requires TASM (Telemark Assembler).

## Running in Z80 Emulator
Tasty Basic can be run in the Z80 Emulator ([Moore, 2015](##References)) when it is built with
the `-Dzemu` flag:

```tasm.exe -t80 -g3 -fFF -Dzemu tastybasic.asm tastybasic.bin tastybasic.lst```

Then load the resulting `tastybasic.bin` image in the emulator at address 0, bank 0.

Before running, ensure that the `TTY0` device is configured as following in the Z80 Emulator:

**I/O Devices**

| Device | CRT | TTY | COM | NET | Printer | Spooler |
|-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-------:|:-------:|
| TTY 0  |     |  x  |     |     |         |         |

**I/O Properties for device 0**

|              | Bit | State | Status |
|--------------|:---:|:-----:|:------:|
| RxFull       | 1   | 1     | 00     |
| TxEmpty      | 0   | 1     |        
| RxFull IntE  | N/A |        
| TxEmpty IntE | N/A |         


## Example BASIC programs

A small number of example BASIC programs are included in the `examples` directory. Most of
these programs are from _BASIC COMPUTER GAMES_ ([Ahl, 1978](##References)), and have been 
modified as required to make them work with Tasty Basic.
